## Atomico components with React Native support

Through the strategy already used in atomico/ssr it is possible to support React Native.

The project is in research phase, the objectives of this are:

1. Discover the ability to homologate the html used within a component created with Atomico with the tags provided by React native.
2. Discover the ability to homologate the css used within an Atomico component and homologate it with the StyleSheet provided by React Native.
3. Create based on the above a prototype of the API.
4. Analyze the feasibility of growth and maintenance of the prototype API.
